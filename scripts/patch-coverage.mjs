// Reports how much of the *logic* a pull request adds is reached by a spec, and fails the build
// when too little of it is. Not a coverage threshold: the global percentage is not a measure of
// anything here (see AGENTS.md § Testing), and a gate on it would be satisfied by registering
// another game. Only the lines this PR adds are measured, so the number cannot be diluted by the
// rest of the repo and cannot drift as the repo grows.
//
// Two decisions make it mean what it says:
//
//   - It reads the coverage of `npm run coverage:unswept`, not `npm run coverage`. The two sweeps
//     (plays-to-an-end, renders) execute nearly every line under games/ while asserting almost
//     nothing, so a new game registered in gameList.ts is *executed* the moment it exists. Measured
//     against the full run, a game with no spec at all reads as fully covered — precisely the PR
//     this is here to catch. With the sweeps excluded, what is left is coverage a real spec caused.
//
//   - It measures added *lines*, not files. Every non-spec .ts file in src/ is already at non-zero
//     coverage, because the overview specs import gameList, which transitively loads every game;
//     the floor is ~10% of top-level import and const lines, not 0%. So "this file is uncovered"
//     never fires, while "these added lines never ran" does.
//
// Failing here means the added logic is not *unit-tested*. It does not mean it is untested: a
// registered game still gets real conformance checking from the plays-to-an-end sweep, which throws
// on an illegal move, a move named after the turn ended, and a game that never ends.
