# durer-jatekok

Code for the online, client-side versions of past strategy games at the DÃ¼rer Math Competition.

The deployed version is here: https://a-gondolkodas-orome.github.io/durer-jatekok/.

# Development

When you push to the main branch, the tests are run, but the project is not deployed.

Currently this project has a Vue.js setup, but you can include games not using Vue.js with small modifications.

## Adding a new game

Currently each game should have a folder under `src/components/games` and its metadata listed in `src/components/games/games.js`. See existing examples for inspiration, and the demonstration game for a minimal example.

You can include work in progress games safely on the main branch as well if you set `isHiddenFromOverview: true` in `games.js`. You can also send a pull request or develop on a branch for a short time.

## Project setup

- install Node.js on your computer globally
- in the project directory terminal run `npm ci`
