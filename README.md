# durer-jatekok

Code for the online, client-side versions of past strategy games at the DÃ¼rer Math Competition.

The deployed version is here: https://a-gondolkodas-orome.github.io/durer-jatekok/.

# Development

Feel free to commit directly to the default branch. If in doubt, send a pull request instead. Prefer rebasing over merge commits.

When you push to the main branch, the tests are run, and if they are successful, the project is deployed to the live website.

## Adding a new game

To keep track of who works on which game, use [this pinned issue](https://github.com/a-gondolkodas-orome/durer-jatekok/issues/1) to track it.

TL;DR;

Currently each game should have a folder under `src/components/games` and its metadata listed in `src/components/games/games.js`. See existing examples for inspiration, and the `demonstration` game for a minimal example.
