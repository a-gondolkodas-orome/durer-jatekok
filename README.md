Code for the online, client-side versions of past strategy games at the Dürer
Math Competition.

The deployed version is here: https://jatek.durerinfo.hu/ .

When you push to the default (main) branch, the tests are run, and if they are
successful, the project is deployed to the live website within a few minutes.

## Project setup

Two ways to get started:

- **Locally**: install the Node.js version in `.nvmrc` globally (or run `nvm use`
  in the project directory), then run `npm ci`.
- **Devcontainer**: a fairly minimal setup, written for local Docker. It pins
  Node and bakes Playwright's Chromium into the image, so container creation
  only has to run `npm ci`; it also ships the GitHub CLI and keeps `gh` and
  Claude Code logins in named volumes across rebuilds. Details below.

Claude Code on the web is neither: its container ships its own Node and starts
without `node_modules`, so `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` installs the pinned
Node through nvm and puts it on `PATH` ahead of the image's own, then runs
`npm ci` unless the installed tree is already sound. It reads the version from
`.nvmrc` rather than restating it, so it is not another place to keep in sync.

<details>
<summary>Devcontainer details</summary>

- **Codespaces** supports only a restricted set of devcontainer properties and
  may ignore the `mounts` block, in which case none of the persistence below
  happens.
- **Playwright**: bumping `playwright` in `package.json` means bumping
  `PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION` in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and rebuilding, or
  Playwright looks for a browser revision that is not in the image.
- **Node** is pinned in four other places besides the devcontainer feature in
  `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (the image tag only fixes the major):
  `.nvmrc`, `engines.node`, and the container image in both
  `.github/workflows/*.yml`. Bump them together, or the container quietly runs
  a different Node than CI. `npm run test` fails on either mismatch, so you
  will not find out the hard way.
- **npm's update notifier is off** (`NPM_CONFIG_UPDATE_NOTIFIER`): the npm that
  matters is the one bundled with the pinned Node.
- **`gh`** does not pick up your SSH key or VS Code's credential helper, so run
  `gh auth login` once inside the container. A fine-grained token limited to
  this repository is enough.
- **Named volumes** keep the `gh` and Claude Code logins across rebuilds
  (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` points at the default path only so `~/.claude.json` lands
  inside the volume too). They take their `node` ownership from the image the
  first time Docker creates them, so a volume from an older version of this
  setup stays root-owned and **rebuilding does not repair it** — `gh auth login`
  keeps failing. Remove them and rebuild:
  `docker volume rm durer-gh-config durer-claude-home`. Volume names are per
  Docker host, so every clone and worktree on one machine shares the login.

## Useful npm commands

```bash
npm run dev              # compiles and hot-reloads for development
npm run test             # lint, typecheck and unit tests, as GitHub Actions runs them
npm run lint:fix         # auto-fix simple formatting errors such as trailing spaces
npm run build            # prod build — some problems only appear here

npm run coverage         # line coverage, on demand
npm run coverage:unswept # the same, without the two all-games sweeps
npm run coverage:patch   # how much of what your branch adds a spec reaches
```

The three coverage commands, and which of them CI gates on, are explained in
[AGENTS.md § Coverage](AGENTS.md#coverage).

## Adding a new game

To keep track of who works on which game, use [this
table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6u9PCtvf_gDHrs65x36pmDzFt4nZZx_IUuXrgS2aZk/edit#gid=0).

1. Add the game metadata to `src/components/games/gameList.ts`.
2. Create a folder for the game under `src/components/games` with the standard
   files: a React-free `gameplay.ts` (the `Board` type, start boards and
   `moves`), `bot-strategy.ts`, the game component `<game>.tsx` (plus
   `board-client.tsx` once the JSX outgrows the game file), and a
   `gameplay.spec.ts` — see [Where it lives](#where-it-lives).
3. Re-export the game component from the barrel in
   `src/components/games/index.ts`, keyed by the game's `gameList` key. The router
   in `src/components/app/app.tsx` picks it up automatically — no edit needed there.

Every field, edge case and enforcement rule of the engine API lives in
[src/components/CLAUDE.md](src/components/CLAUDE.md). *It is recommended to copy
and modify an existing, similar game.*

## Anatomy of a game

This project uses the React frontend "framework"; the [official
tutorial](https://react.dev/learn) is a good starting point. The common parts of
all games (showing rules, alternating turns, buttons for choosing a role,
restart game) are extracted to a `strategyGameFactory`, which a game hands four
things.

<details>

<summary>A minimal demonstrative example</summary>

```tsx
// gameplay.ts — the React-free rules half of the game
export type Board = number;

export const moves = {
  addNumber: {
    // annotate every move argument: an unannotated one types as `any` and
    // silently disables the bot's argument type-checking
    apply: (board: Board, { ctx }: { ctx: Ctx }, amount: number) => {
      const nextBoard = board + amount;
      if (nextBoard >= 20) {
        return { nextBoard, gameEnd: { winnerIndex: 1 - ctx.currentPlayer! } };
      }
      return { nextBoard, isTurnEnd: true };
    }
  }
};

export type Moves = typeof moves;

// bot-strategy.ts — `Moves` pins the move names and argument types
const botStrategy: BotStrategy<Board, Moves> = ({ board }) => {
  const optimalStep = board % 3 === 0 ? 1 : (3 - board % 3)
  return { move: 'addNumber', args: [optimalStep] };
};

// <game>.tsx — the React side: BoardClient and the factory call
const BoardClient = ({ board, ctx, moves }: BoardClientProps<Board>) => {
  // no handler guard needed: the framework ignores dispatches that are not
  // allowed; `disabled` is for the player's benefit
  return <GameBoard>
    <button disabled={!ctx.isClientMoveAllowed} onClick={() => moves.addNumber(board, 1)}>1</button>
    <button disabled={!ctx.isClientMoveAllowed} onClick={() => moves.addNumber(board, 2)}>2</button>
  </GameBoard>
};

export const PlusOneTwo = strategyGameFactory({
  presentation: {
    rule: <>0-ról +1/+2 20-ig</>,
    getPlayerStepDescription: () => 'Válaszd ki, hogy hánnyal növelsz.'
  },
  BoardClient,
  gameplay: { moves },
  variants: [{ botStrategy, generateStartBoard: () => 0 }]
});
```
</details>

**`gameplay.moves`** — a move is one player-initiated change to the board, and
the unit that keeps the game played by its rules. Each is `{ apply, validate? }`.
`apply` is a pure reducer that *returns* everything it causes — the next board,
and whether the turn passed, the game ended or the mid-turn state changed —
rather than causing it, and it applies its arguments blindly. Legality lives in
the optional `validate` next to it, the single source of truth: the engine
enforces it, and the `BoardClient` reads it back as
`moves.<name>.isAllowed(board, ...args)` to drive `disabled`.

**`BoardClient`** — the React component that draws the board and dispatches
moves, given `board`, `ctx`, `moves` and `setTurnState`. State that only matters
within a turn (a hover, a pending selection) belongs in the component, not in
`board`.

**`variants[]`** — each supplies `generateStartBoard()` or `startBoards`, and a
`botStrategy`: a pure function of the position that *names* the move it wants,
`({ board, ctx }) => ({ move, args })`. See [src/components/CLAUDE.md § Bot
contract](src/components/CLAUDE.md#bot-contract), and [AGENTS.md §
Testing](AGENTS.md#testing) for what being a pure function buys a spec.

**`presentation`** — the rule text and `getPlayerStepDescription`, both i18n
values.

### Where it lives

A game folder splits along one line: `gameplay.ts` holds the `Board` type, the
start boards, the `moves` and the legality and win-detection helpers they use,
and never imports React — ESLint enforces that. The rest (`bot-strategy.ts`,
`board-client.tsx`, `<game>.tsx` with the rule text and the factory call) sits
on the React side. Which file holds what, and why the split exists, is in
[AGENTS.md § Files in a game folder](AGENTS.md#files-in-a-game-folder).

### board and ctx

`board` holds only what is specific to this game. Everything common is managed
by the framework in `ctx`: `currentPlayer`, `isClientMoveAllowed` (guard every
player interaction with it), `isHumanVsHumanGame`, `chosenRoleIndex`, and
`turnState` for multi-stage turns. Never modify either in place.

A multi-stage game pins what its `turnState` holds ([§ Pinning the turn
state](src/components/CLAUDE.md#pinning-the-turn-state)), and every move takes
the current `board` as its first argument, including subsequent moves within one
turn ([§ Game state
architecture](src/components/CLAUDE.md#game-state-architecture-synchronous-store-outside-react)
for why, given that the store is authoritative either way).

## Before opening a PR

Walk the [new game
checklist](src/components/CLAUDE.md#new-game-checklist) — both game modes,
balanced starting positions, an AI the player cannot beat with a losing
strategy, keyboard and mobile usability.

## Internationalisation (i18n)

The site supports Hungarian (default) and English. See `TicTacToe`
for a complete example. English translations are added on a game-per-game bases,
it is fine to add new games with Hungarian only.

The `t()` helper from `translate.ts` resolves a value to the active language.
The value can be a plain string if there are no translations available, or a
`{ hu, en }` object. It is reached through the `language` barrel, which is a
path alias — `import { useTranslation } from 'language';`, no `../../../`.

Check the [Dürer Archive](https://durerinfo.hu/archivum/feladatsorok/) for
existing translations.

For an example of internationalizing an existing game, see
[PR #213](https://github.com/a-gondolkodas-orome/durer-jatekok/pull/213).

## Technologies used

<details>

- Node.js for the development server and building the application
- React frontend framework ([official tutorial](https://react.dev/learn) is a
  good starting point)
- Tailwindcss for styling with utility classes
- vitest for unit testing (runs in CI; every game is swept by a conformance test)
- github actions for CI/CD.
- github pages as hosting
- [self-hosted umami](https://umami.durerinfo.hu) as usage tracker

</details>

## Dependency updates

Every version is pinned exactly (`save-exact=true`), so nothing drifts on its own
— and nothing goes stale loudly either. `.github/workflows/dependency_report.yml`
runs monthly and keeps one `OPS` issue in sync with whatever is behind (npm
packages, actions, the Node in `.nvmrc`); `npm run report:outdated` prints the
same table on demand. It opens no pull requests — upgrading stays deliberate,
majors one at a time as in
[#168](https://github.com/a-gondolkodas-orome/durer-jatekok/issues/168). Why a
report rather than dependabot or renovate: the header comment of
`scripts/dependency-report.mjs`.
