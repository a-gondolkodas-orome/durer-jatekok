// The bot contract: a strategy NAMES the moves it wants — one, or the whole
// turn when the turn is one decision — and its caller plays them out: the React
// shell with a pause between them so the bot appears to think, the headless
// runner (run-match.ts) immediately.
//
// Pacing is therefore the caller's concern, never the strategy's: a bot that
// scheduled its own follow-up move with setTimeout could not run outside a
// browser, which is exactly what an authoritative server would have to do
// (docs/real-competitions-plan.md).
