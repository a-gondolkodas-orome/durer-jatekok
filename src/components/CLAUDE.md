# Game and engine authoring

Loaded when working under `src/components/` — the games in `games/` and the
`strategy-game-factory` engine they are built on. Project-wide context (what
this project is, testing policy, styling, i18n, PR conventions) lives in
`AGENTS.md` at the repo root.

## Adding a new game

Follow the steps in [README.md § Adding a new
game](../../README.md#adding-a-new-game). Use `strategyGameFactory` (see
`strategy-game-factory.tsx`) — copy a similar existing game as a starting point.

### strategyGameFactory API

Required params: `presentation`, `BoardClient`, `gameplay`, `variants`.

```typescript
strategyGameFactory({
  presentation: {
    rule,                      // i18n rules text shown in collapsible section
    roleLabels?,               // optional: [{ hu, en }, { hu, en }] — defaults to "1st/2nd player"
    getPlayerStepDescription,  // ({ board, ctx }) => { hu, en } — shown as turn instruction
  },
  BoardClient,                 // React component receiving { board, ctx, moves, setTurnState }
  gameplay: {
    moves,                     // { [name]: { apply, validate? } } — see below
    endOfTurnMove?,            // optional move name auto-executed after moves with autoEndOfTurn: true
  },
  variants,                    // see below
})
```

**`variants`** — array of `{ id?, botStrategy?, generateStartBoard?,
startBoards?, label?, isDefault? }`. The default variant (marked
`isDefault: true`, or the
only entry if there is just one) must state its start position. If
`botStrategy` is omitted on a variant, the default variant's `botStrategy` is
used as fallback. If multiple variants are provided, exactly one must be
`isDefault: true`. A single-entry array needs no `isDefault` flag.

A variant states that start position **either** as `generateStartBoard`
(`() => Board`) **or** as `startBoards` (`Board[]`, a curated list the engine
picks from at random) — declaring both throws, as does an empty list.
`startBoards` is the declarative form: the engine derives the generator from
it, so nothing downstream distinguishes the two. Reach for it whenever the
positions are enumerable rather than sampled — a competition hands out one
entry per attempt (#314), so the list order is part of the contract (append,
never reorder), and a spec can judge every entry instead of calling the
generator a few hundred times until they have all come up. Each pick is cloned,
so a curated board is as freshly owned by its match as a generated one.

Curated boards want `forcedWinnerIndex` (`test-utils`) in their spec: it plays
the game's own optimal bot against itself and returns the role that forces the
win, throwing when playouts disagree. Assert the *role*, not just that the game
ends — that is the property a competition depends on, since the team's role
**Variants are addressable in the URL** as `?variant=`, alongside `?lang=` —
`#/game/CoinsIn3Piles?variant=3-5-7`. The param and the selected variant are
kept in step both ways: choosing a variant rewrites the param, and a param that
changes without a remount is followed. The default variant is the param's
*absence* (as `hu` is for `?lang=`), so dropping it selects the default; a param
naming no variant of that game is ignored rather than obeyed.

Following the param matters because of the one case that is easy to miss: the
app is hash-routed, so navigating to a `?variant=` link for the game **already
open** remounts nothing. Read once on mount, such a link would change the URL
and leave the board untouched — which is exactly the link people share. The
cost is that following it restarts the game, but that is what choosing a variant
means everywhere else in the UI, so the URL should not be the exception.

`id` is what the param names. It is optional — a variant without one is
addressed by its index, which is enough for most games — and is worth declaring
where variants are really separate games and a link should survive them being
reordered (`coins-in-3-piles`, `chess-ducks`, `ten-coins`). Ids must be unique,
and must not read as another variant's index; both throw. Adding ids everywhere
is not a goal: do it case by case, when a durable link is actually wanted.

That key is what a variant is named by everywhere it is named at all: the URL,
the `game-finished` analytics event (`variant: '3-5-7'` rather than
`variant: 2`), and the per-visitor win/loss counts in `localStorage`
(`stats_<gameId>_<variantKey>`). So declaring an id buys more than a durable
link — it also keeps that game's tallies and its dashboard rows attached to the
variant they belong to. Where no id is declared the key is the index, and all
three only mean anything as long as that game's variant order holds; reordering
hands a variant the tally of whichever one used to sit at its position.

See `coins-in-3-piles`, and
`stones-remove-one-not-twice-from-left`, which uses it to cross-check the win
predicate its own balance test relies on. A game whose bot searches too deeply
to play out repeatedly verifies its list against a characterisation instead —
`bacteria` judges every curated board with `deficiency` and an independent
brute-force solver.

**`moves`** — every move is `{ apply, validate? }`: an optional legality
predicate paired with an outcome-returning
`(board, { ctx }, ...args) => MoveOutcome`. A move is handed nothing it could
cause an effect through — everything it causes is data in the returned
`MoveOutcome`:
`{ nextBoard, isTurnEnd?, nextTurnState?, gameEnd?, autoEndOfTurn? }`.
`isTurnEnd: true` passes the turn (omitted = further moves follow in the same
turn); `gameEnd: { winnerIndex }` ends the game with an always-explicit winner
(`ctx.currentPlayer!` when the mover wins) and never flips `currentPlayer` —
`isTurnEnd`/`autoEndOfTurn` alongside it are a dev-mode error;
`nextTurnState` sets `ctx.turnState` (`null` clears, omitted keeps);
`autoEndOfTurn: true` schedules `endOfTurnMove`. Causing nothing directly is
what makes a move a pure reducer, and what lets the same function run in a
future authoritative competition server (see issue #313).

Always pass the current `board` as first arg when chaining moves within a turn.
`apply` does not validate its arguments — it applies them blindly; legality is
enforced by `validate` (below) and/or the `BoardClient`'s `disabled` gating.

**`validate`** (optional, per move) — a pure, side-effect-free legality predicate
`(board, { ctx }, ...args) => boolean` sitting right next to its `apply`. When
present, the engine rejects any dispatch whose args fail it (in dev it throws
loudly to surface the bug; in prod it warns, fires an `illegal-move` analytics
event, and no-ops so a stray call cannot corrupt the board). Omitting it means
"always legal", so this is fully opt-in and moves whose legality is trivial
simply leave it out. The validator is the **single source of truth** for
legality: it drives the engine's enforcement, and — being React-free — a
possible future server-side authoritative check can reuse the same predicate.
Do **not** put the "whose turn is it" check (`ctx.isClientMoveAllowed`) inside
`validate`; the engine folds that in for the client (below). The engine hands
out two wrappings of the same moves: the `moves` object the `BoardClient`
receives **silently ignores** any dispatch that fails `isAllowed` (so a stray
click — even on a button a browser failed to disable — is a harmless no-op),
while bot and auto `endOfTurnMove` dispatches are checked against `validate`
alone and fail loudly (dev: throw; prod: warn + `illegal-move` analytics event
+ no-op), since there an illegal move is a bug. See `coins-in-3-piles`
(two-phase turn) and `cube-coloring` (reuses the existing `isAllowedStep`
helper) for examples.

Both halves take `(board, { ctx }, ...args)`, and the meta slot sits *before* the
game-specific args, so it has to be written even when the move ignores it. Write
it `_` then — `validate: (board: Board, _, cell: number) => …` — and `_board`
when it is the board that goes unread instead. This is the repo-wide rule for
unused parameters (AGENTS.md § Unused parameters); ESLint enforces it.

**`moves.<name>.isAllowed(board, ...args)`** — exposed on every move of the
`BoardClient`'s wrapped `moves` object: `ctx.isClientMoveAllowed` (turn
ownership) AND the move's `validate` (when defined), with `ctx` already bound.
Drive button `disabled` state with it. Because the engine applies the same
check to every client dispatch, click handlers need no `if (!allowed) return`
guards — keep one only when the handler couples local UI state to a successful
move (see `cube-coloring`'s colour-selection reset). Not for bots: a bot is
handed no move wrappers at all (see the bot contract below), so it enumerates
legal moves via the raw `validate`/helpers instead.

**Bot contract** — a `botStrategy` is a pure function of the position,
`({ board, ctx }) => BotMove | BotMove[]`, where a `BotMove` is
`{ move: string, args?: unknown[] }`. It **names** the move it wants rather than
playing it: no move wrappers, no board to thread, no `setTimeout`. Naming a
whole turn at once is the right shape when the turn is one decision made of
several moves (`pile-splitter`: discard a pile, split another; `magic-box`:
place a stone, designate a line); naming one move and being asked again with
the updated `board`/`ctx` is equally fine (`take-and-point`). The engine plays
the named moves out — with `stepDelay()` (`engine/timing.ts`) between them in
the browser so the bot appears to think, immediately in a headless match — and
asks the strategy again while the turn is still its own. Naming a move after the
turn ended is a bug (dev: throw); naming moves the game-winning move made moot
is fine (they are dropped).

Two hosts play a named turn out: the browser shell in
`strategy-game-factory.tsx` and the headless runner in `engine/run-match.ts`.
They differ deliberately in pacing and in how loudly they complain — a bad
strategy must not crash the site in production, while headless it should throw
— but *which* moves land has to be identical.
`engine/bot-turn-agreement.spec.tsx` plays the same turn through both and
compares, so the two cannot drift apart on what counts as a bug.

Left unpinned, `BotMove` is `{ move: string, args?: unknown[] }`, so neither a
mistyped name nor wrong arguments surface until the bot plays the move (dev:
throw). A game pins both by exporting its moves as a type, next to the moves
themselves:

```ts
// gameplay.ts, under the moves object
export type Moves = typeof moves;

// bot-strategy.ts
import type { Board, Moves } from './gameplay';

type Bot = BotStrategy<Board, Moves>

export const smartBotStrategy: Bot = ({ board }) => ({ move: 'removeLine', args: [choice] });
```

`BotStrategy<Board, Moves>` derives the move names **and** each move's argument
list from `apply`, so a typo, a wrong arity and a wrong argument type are all
typecheck errors at the bot that made them. A helper that builds a turn's moves
takes the same parameter: `BotMove<Moves>[]` (see `coins-in-3-piles`'s
`asTurn`).

The argument half is only as precise as `apply`'s signature — an unannotated
parameter there types as `any` and silently checks nothing, so annotate them.
`BotStrategy<Board>` (or a bare name union) still works and pins nothing beyond
the name; a game that has not been converted yet keeps compiling.

**`ctx`** fields available in moves and `BoardClient`:
- `currentPlayer`: 0/1 — use this for game logic in both modes
- `isClientMoveAllowed`: boolean — guard all player interactions with this
- `isHumanVsHumanGame`: boolean — branch mode-specific rendering if needed
- `chosenRoleIndex`: null/0/1 — only meaningful in vsComputer mode
- `turnState`: use for multi-stage turns or other state that needs to be
  remembered during a turn if needed, i.e. to expose it from BoardClient to
  getPlayerStepDescription

**Pinning the turn state.** Left unpinned, `ctx.turnState` is `unknown`, and
every reader casts. A multi-stage game names the shape instead, next to the
moves that produce it:

```ts
// gameplay.ts — the payload only; the engine adds the `| null` every turn
// starts and ends in
export type TurnState = { firstSelectedPile: number };
```

```tsx
// board-client.tsx — annotating the props is what pins the whole game
const BoardClient = ({ ctx, setTurnState }: BoardClientProps<Board, TurnState>) => {
  const { turnState } = ctx;   // TurnState | null, no cast
```

The factory infers `TTurnState` from the config, so the game file's
`getPlayerStepDescription` takes `StrategyArgs<Board, TurnState>`, each move's
meta takes `{ ctx: Ctx<TurnState> }` and its `apply` returns
`MoveOutcome<Board, TurnState>` — annotate all of them, since inference reads
every one of those sites and a leftover bare `Ctx` contradicts the rest. A spec
that builds a ctx names it too: `makeCtx<TurnState>({ … })`. Games with no
mid-turn state say nothing and keep compiling.

Bots are deliberately left out: a bot is asked again with a fresh `ctx` for
every move it still owes, so it plans a whole turn rather than reading its own
half-made selection back. `BotStrategy` therefore stays
`BotStrategy<Board, Moves>` and sees `turnState` as `unknown`.

**`setTurnState(stage)`** — a `BoardClient`-only prop, for components that keep
mid-turn UI state in `ctx.turnState`. It is the one path that writes engine
state without going through a move, deliberately: a selection is not a move, so
it must not bump `moveCount` or take an undo snapshot. Moves never get it; they
return `nextTurnState` instead.

**`useMoveScopedState(ctx.moveCount, initial)`** — for a `BoardClient`'s own
mid-turn UI state: a half-made selection, a pending set of removals. The value
is stamped with the `moveCount` at which it was set and exposed only while that
stamp holds, so any move discards it during the next render.

Do not clear such state with `useEffect(() => setX(initial), [ctx.moveCount])`.
That repairs it one render too late — the browser paints a frame with the old
selection over the advanced board — and it is a reset every component has to
remember rather than a property of the state itself.

```tsx
const [selectedCell, setSelectedCell] = useMoveScopedState<number | null>(ctx.moveCount, null);
```

Two things to get right: `initial` is handed back on every stale render, so a
non-primitive must be one stable reference (hoist it to module scope, never
`[]` inline); and mid-turn state the *engine* has to see — anything
`getPlayerStepDescription` reads — belongs in `ctx.turnState` instead, since
this hook is local to the component.

`useHoverPreview(ctx.moveCount)` is this hook plus pointer/focus plumbing, so
board previews get the same invalidation for free.

**`useDeferredMove(ctx.moveCount)`** — for a `BoardClient` whose single click
submits a whole turn made of two moves (`pile-splitter`, `three-piles-rebuild`).
Dispatch the first move, then hand the second to the returned function: it plays
a `STEP_DELAY` later, so the board reads as two actions rather than one jump —
the same beat the engine gives a bot's multi-move turn.

Do not schedule that beat with a bare `setTimeout`. The callback closes over the
board the first move produced, so a restart, a variant switch or an undo inside
the window fires the move at a position that is gone — in dev that throws
"stale board passed to move". The hook cancels on all of those (they rewind
`moveCount`) and on unmount.

```tsx
const deferMove = useDeferredMove(ctx.moveCount);

const clickPiece = ({ pileId, pieceId }: Piece) => {
  const { nextBoard } = moves.removePile(board, 1 - pileId);
  deferMove(() => moves.splitPile(nextBoard, { pileId, pieceCount: pieceId + 1 }));
};
```

### Game state architecture: synchronous store outside React

Authoritative game state (`board`, `phase`, `currentPlayer`, `turnState`,
`moveCount`, …) lives in a small synchronous store outside React
(`strategy-game-factory/engine/store.ts`); the factory component subscribes via
`useSyncExternalStore` and renders snapshots of it. Every dispatch — from the
`BoardClient`, a bot, or the auto `endOfTurnMove` — is validated and applied by
a framework-free reducer (`engine/reducer.ts`)
against `store.getState()`, so bots and chained `setTimeout` dispatches can
never observe a stale render snapshot. Validators may depend on **any** `ctx`
field (`turnState`, `moveCount`, …); `ctx` is always derived fresh from the
store (`engine/build-ctx.ts`). This boardgame.io-style architecture replaced
the earlier per-field workarounds (a render-synced `ctxRef` shadow) that made
staleness a reviewable hazard.

Two conventions to keep in mind:

- **`board` threading stays the public API shape**: always pass the latest
  `nextBoard` when chaining moves within a turn. The store board is
  authoritative regardless — in dev the engine **throws** on a mismatch
  ("stale board passed to move …", converting a chaining bug into a loud,
  located error), in prod the store board silently wins. The argument stays
  because it keeps a move a pure function of its inputs, callable on
  hypothetical boards outside a live game — bot look-ahead and specs both do
  that.
- The `engine/` modules are React-free by design — they are the seed of the
  headless engine a future server-authoritative competition mode needs (see
  issue #313). Don't import React (or
  anything React-flavoured) there; ESLint enforces it, as it does for each
  game's `gameplay.ts`.

Note "boardgame.io-style" means the architecture only. **Do not propose
adopting boardgame.io itself**: it is a good library but effectively
unmaintained (no meaningful releases for years, and its React client pins
React versions well behind the one used here). Borrow its ideas — the
long-form move shape and the external store already do — and build the rest
in-repo.

### New game checklist

- Game works correctly in both `vsComputer` and `vsHuman` mode
- Starting positions representative of the game's complexity; each player wins
  with ~50% probability across random starting boards
- Player cannot win with a non-winning strategy (i.e. AI is truly optimal)
- Any precomputed move table ships with its generator in
  `scripts/pre-generate-ai-moves/`, and re-running it reproduces the committed
  file
- Board type, start boards and moves live in a React-free `gameplay.ts`
- Moves return their consequences rather than causing them (see
  `five-connected-fields`, `coins-in-3-piles`, `hunyadi-and-the-janissaries`)
- Moves with non-trivial legality define `validate` (single source of truth for
  the engine, the `BoardClient`'s `disabled` state and the bot)
- Clear what the player should do next (`getPlayerStepDescription`)
- Interactions disabled during the other player's turn (`ctx.isClientMoveAllowed`)
- Mobile-friendly and keyboard-navigable
- Player can undo within a multi-move turn where that applies
- Neither `board` nor `ctx` is ever modified in place
- Watching the bot play does not give the winning strategy away outright
- The bot names its moves and schedules nothing: the engine paces multi-move
  turns so the AI appears to "think"

### Bot / variant conventions

These are deliberate design choices — treat them as expected, don't "fix" them:

- **Test bots carry no `notAlwaysOptimal` flag.** Being easy to beat is the whole
  point of a "Test" bot. The `notAlwaysOptimal` flag (which renders the ⓘ marker
  in `game-controls.tsx`) is only for a *smart/optimal* bot that in a few
  positions may fail to punish a mistake.
- **The "Teszt / Test" variant name is intentional** — it means "test your
  understanding of the rules before a real game", matching competition usage. Do
  not rename it to "Easy".
- **A role that always wins regardless of the start board is acceptable** and does
  not violate the ~50/50 win-probability guideline above.
