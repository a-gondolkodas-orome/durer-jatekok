 * smallest legible size, each piece then stretching into whatever the division
 * left over. So the same board is a pair of dense little cards on a phone and

 * gap: pieces the two halves would be laid out in stay in the one grid, in the
 * slots they already occupy. Moving them is what would put a different piece
 * under a stationary pointer, and — since a piece would change parent — drop
 * the focus of anyone walking the pile by keyboard.
