// circle player's reply with a second winning pair-heat, then run the forced
// march. The plan covers every circle reply from the start position, so as the
// line player this bot always wins.
//
// CIRCLE side — best-effort defence: the line player wins this board with
// perfect play, so no circle strategy is "optimal" in the winning sense. The
// bot never volunteers into a position that is already lost by the two-hot
// criterion (isLineTurnWon), covers threats, defuses pre-threat edges, and uses
// the bounded search to dodge deeper tactics — a human playing line only beats
// it by executing a genuine winning plan.
