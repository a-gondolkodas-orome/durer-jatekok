// Plays every registered game headlessly, through the real moves, the real
// validators and the real reducer. `runMatch` throws on everything this is
// meant to catch — a bot naming a move the game does not have, a move its own
// `validate` rejects, moves named after the turn ended, and a game that never
// reaches an end — so the assertion is simply that a match completes and names
// a winner.
//
// This is a conformance test for the *game*, not for the bot's judgement:
// whether the smart bot wins from a winning position belongs in the game's own
// bot-strategy spec.

// A variant is listed here only because its bot searches deeply enough to
// dominate the suite's runtime — several cost seconds, and swing by more than
// 10x with the random start board they get. A game's rules are shared by all
// its variants, so a cheap variant covers the same moves, validators and win
// detection; what is lost is the coverage of that bot, which its own spec has.
// Two games have no cheap variant left and so drop out of the sweep entirely:
// AmorAndCupido (a single, searching variant) and TriangularGridRopes15 (both
// variants search). Both have a bot-strategy spec of their own.
